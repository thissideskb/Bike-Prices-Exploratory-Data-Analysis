# Bike-Prices-Exploratory-Data-Analysis
# 🏍️ Bike Prices Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project explores the **Bike Details dataset** using **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**.  
It includes **data cleaning, visualization, and insights** to understand factors affecting bike selling prices.

## 📚 Key Steps Performed

- Loaded the dataset and explored its structure.  
- Checked for **missing values** and handled them appropriately.  
- Conducted **summary statistics** (mean, median, std) for numeric columns.  
- Visualized **distribution of selling prices** using histograms.  
- Analyzed **average price by seller type**.  
- Compared **average km driven across ownership types**.  
- Detected and removed **outliers in `km_driven` using the IQR method**.  
- Created a **scatter plot of year vs selling price** to see the trend.  
- Encoded categorical features using **one-hot encoding**.  
- Performed **correlation analysis** and visualized it with a heatmap.  
- Summarized key insights based on the analysis.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  

## 📊 Insights

- Newer bikes generally have **higher selling prices**.  
- **Dealers list bikes at higher prices** compared to individual sellers.  
- **Higher km driven** reduces the bike’s price.  
- Outliers in `km_driven` can distort analysis, so they were removed.  
- Strong **positive correlation** between `year` and `price`, and **negative correlation** with `km_driven`.
